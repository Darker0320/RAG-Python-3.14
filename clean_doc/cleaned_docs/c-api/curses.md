# Curses C API

`curses` exposes a small C interface for extension modules.
Consumers must include the header file `py_curses.h` (which is not
included by default by `Python.h`) and `import_curses()` must
be invoked, usually as part of the module initialisation function, to populate
`PyCurses_API`.

Warning

Neither the C API nor the pure Python `curses` module are compatible
with subinterpreters.

import\_curses()
Import the curses C API. The macro does not need a semi-colon to be called.

    On success, populate the `PyCurses_API` pointer.

    On failure, set `PyCurses_API` to NULL and set an exception.
    The caller must check if an error occurred via `PyErr_Occurred()`:

    ```
    import_curses();// semi-colon is optional but recommended
    if(PyErr_Occurred()){/* cleanup */}
    ```

void\*\*PyCurses\_API
Dynamically allocated object containing the curses C API.
    This variable is only available once `import_curses` succeeds.

    `PyCurses_API[0]` corresponds to `PyCursesWindow_Type`.

    `PyCurses_API[1]`, `PyCurses_API[2]`, and `PyCurses_API[3]`
    are pointers to predicate functions of type `int (*)(void)`.

    When called, these predicates return whether `curses.setupterm()`,
    `curses.initscr()`, and `curses.start_color()` have been called
    respectively.

    See also the convenience macros `PyCursesSetupTermCalled`,
    `PyCursesInitialised`, and `PyCursesInitialisedColor`.

    Note

    The number of entries in this structure is subject to changes.
    Consider using `PyCurses_API_pointers` to check if
    new fields are available or not.

PyCurses\_API\_pointers
The number of accessible fields (`4`) in `PyCurses_API`.
    This number is incremented whenever new fields are added.

PyTypeObjectPyCursesWindow\_Type
The heap type corresponding to `curses.window`.

intPyCursesWindow\_Check(PyObject\*op)
Return true if *op* is a `curses.window` instance, false otherwise.

The following macros are convenience macros expanding into C statements.
In particular, they can only be used as `macro;` or `macro`, but not
`macro()` or `macro();`.

PyCursesSetupTermCalled
Macro checking if `curses.setupterm()` has been called.

    The macro expansion is roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    {
    typedefint(*predicate_t)(void);
    predicate_twas_setupterm_called=(predicate_t)PyCurses_API[1];
    if(!was_setupterm_called()){
    returnNULL;
    }
    }
    ```

PyCursesInitialised
Macro checking if `curses.initscr()` has been called.

    The macro expansion is roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    {
    typedefint(*predicate_t)(void);
    predicate_twas_initscr_called=(predicate_t)PyCurses_API[2];
    if(!was_initscr_called()){
    returnNULL;
    }
    }
    ```

PyCursesInitialisedColor
Macro checking if `curses.start_color()` has been called.

    The macro expansion is roughly equivalent to:

    ```
    {
    typedefint(*predicate_t)(void);
    predicate_twas_start_color_called=(predicate_t)PyCurses_API[3];
    if(!was_start_color_called()){
    returnNULL;
    }
    }
    ```

# Internal data

The following objects are exposed by the C API but should be considered
internal-only.

PyCurses\_CAPSULE\_NAME
Name of the curses capsule to pass to `PyCapsule_Import()`.

    Internal usage only. Use `import_curses` instead.
