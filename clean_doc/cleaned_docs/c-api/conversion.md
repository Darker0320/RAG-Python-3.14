# String conversion and formatting

Functions for number conversion and formatted string output.

intPyOS\_snprintf(char\*str, size\_tsize, constchar\*format, ...)
*Part of the Stable ABI.*

    Output not more than *size* bytes to *str* according to the format string
    *format* and the extra arguments. See the Unix man page *snprintf(3)*.

intPyOS\_vsnprintf(char\*str, size\_tsize, constchar\*format, va\_listva)
*Part of the Stable ABI.*

    Output not more than *size* bytes to *str* according to the format string
    *format* and the variable argument list *va*. Unix man page
    *vsnprintf(3)*.

`PyOS_snprintf()` and `PyOS_vsnprintf()` wrap the Standard C library
functions `snprintf()` and `vsnprintf()`. Their purpose is to
guarantee consistent behavior in corner cases, which the Standard C functions do
not.

The wrappers ensure that `str[size-1]` is always `'\0'` upon return. They
never write more than *size* bytes (including the trailing `'\0'`) into str.
Both functions require that `str != NULL`, `size > 0`, `format != NULL`
and `size < INT_MAX`. Note that this means there is no equivalent to the C99
`n = snprintf(NULL, 0, ...)` which would determine the necessary buffer size.

The return value (*rv*) for these functions should be interpreted as follows:

* When `0 <= rv < size`, the output conversion was successful and *rv*
  characters were written to *str* (excluding the trailing `'\0'` byte at
  `str[rv]`).
* When `rv >= size`, the output conversion was truncated and a buffer with
  `rv + 1` bytes would have been needed to succeed. `str[size-1]` is `'\0'`
  in this case.
* When `rv < 0`, the output conversion failed and `str[size-1]` is `'\0'` in
  this case too, but the rest of *str* is undefined. The exact cause of the error
  depends on the underlying platform.

The following functions provide locale-independent string to number conversions.

unsignedlongPyOS\_strtoul(constchar\*str, char\*\*ptr, intbase)
*Part of the Stable ABI.*

    Convert the initial part of the string in `str` to an unsignedlong value according to the given `base`, which must be between `2` and
    `36` inclusive, or be the special value `0`.

    Leading white space and case of characters are ignored. If `base` is zero
    it looks for a leading `0b`, `0o` or `0x` to tell which base. If
    these are absent it defaults to `10`. Base must be 0 or between 2 and 36
    (inclusive). If `ptr` is non-`NULL` it will contain a pointer to the
    end of the scan.

    If the converted value falls out of range of corresponding return type,
    range error occurs (`errno` is set to `ERANGE`) and
    `ULONG_MAX` is returned. If no conversion can be performed, `0`
    is returned.

    See also the Unix man page *strtoul(3)*.

    Added in version 3.2.

longPyOS\_strtol(constchar\*str, char\*\*ptr, intbase)
*Part of the Stable ABI.*

    Convert the initial part of the string in `str` to an long value
    according to the given `base`, which must be between `2` and `36`
    inclusive, or be the special value `0`.

    Same as `PyOS_strtoul()`, but return a long value instead
    and `LONG_MAX` on overflows.

    See also the Unix man page *strtol(3)*.

    Added in version 3.2.

doublePyOS\_string\_to\_double(constchar\*s, char\*\*endptr, PyObject\*overflow\_exception)
*Part of the Stable ABI.*

    Convert a string `s` to a double, raising a Python
    exception on failure. The set of accepted strings corresponds to
    the set of strings accepted by Python’s `float()` constructor,
    except that `s` must not have leading or trailing whitespace.
    The conversion is independent of the current locale.

    If `endptr` is `NULL`, convert the whole string. Raise
    `ValueError` and return `-1.0` if the string is not a valid
    representation of a floating-point number.

    If endptr is not `NULL`, convert as much of the string as
    possible and set `*endptr` to point to the first unconverted
    character. If no initial segment of the string is the valid
    representation of a floating-point number, set `*endptr` to point
    to the beginning of the string, raise ValueError, and return
    `-1.0`.

    If `s` represents a value that is too large to store in a float
    (for example, `"1e500"` is such a string on many platforms) then
    if `overflow_exception` is `NULL` return `Py_INFINITY` (with
    an appropriate sign) and don’t set any exception. Otherwise,
    `overflow_exception` must point to a Python exception object;
    raise that exception and return `-1.0`. In both cases, set
    `*endptr` to point to the first character after the converted value.

    If any other error occurs during the conversion (for example an
    out-of-memory error), set the appropriate Python exception and
    return `-1.0`.

    Added in version 3.1.

char\*PyOS\_double\_to\_string(doubleval, charformat\_code, intprecision, intflags, int\*ptype)
*Part of the Stable ABI.*

    Convert a double *val* to a string using supplied
    *format\_code*, *precision*, and *flags*.

    *format\_code* must be one of `'e'`, `'E'`, `'f'`, `'F'`,
    `'g'`, `'G'` or `'r'`. For `'r'`, the supplied *precision*
    must be 0 and is ignored. The `'r'` format code specifies the
    standard `repr()` format.

    *flags* can be zero or more of the following values or-ed together:

    Py\_DTSF\_SIGN
Always precede the returned string with a sign
        character, even if *val* is non-negative.

    Py\_DTSF\_ADD\_DOT\_0
Ensure that the returned string will not look like an integer.

    Py\_DTSF\_ALT
Apply “alternate” formatting rules.
        See the documentation for the `PyOS_snprintf()` `'#'` specifier for
        details.

    Py\_DTSF\_NO\_NEG\_0
Negative zero is converted to positive zero.

        Added in version 3.11.

    If *ptype* is non-`NULL`, then the value it points to will be set to one
    of the following constants depending on the type of *val*:

    | *\*ptype* | type of *val* |
    | --- | --- |
    | Py\_DTST\_FINITE | finite number |
    | Py\_DTST\_INFINITE | infinite number |
    | Py\_DTST\_NAN | not a number |

    The return value is a pointer to *buffer* with the converted string or
    `NULL` if the conversion failed. The caller is responsible for freeing the
    returned string by calling `PyMem_Free()`.

    Added in version 3.1.

intPyOS\_mystricmp(constchar\*str1, constchar\*str2)

intPyOS\_mystrnicmp(constchar\*str1, constchar\*str2, Py\_ssize\_tsize)
*Part of the Stable ABI.*

    Case insensitive comparison of strings. These functions work almost
    identically to `strcmp()` and `strncmp()` (respectively),
    except that they ignore the case of ASCII characters.

    Return `0` if the strings are equal, a negative value if *str1* sorts
    lexicographically before *str2*, or a positive value if it sorts after.

    In the *str1* or *str2* arguments, a NUL byte marks the end of the string.
    For `PyOS_mystrnicmp()`, the *size* argument gives the maximum size
    of the string, as if NUL was present at the index given by *size*.

    These functions do not use the locale.

intPyOS\_stricmp(constchar\*str1, constchar\*str2)

intPyOS\_strnicmp(constchar\*str1, constchar\*str2, Py\_ssize\_tsize)
Case insensitive comparison of strings.

    On Windows, these are aliases of `stricmp()` and `strnicmp()`,
    respectively.

    On other platforms, they are aliases of `PyOS_mystricmp()` and
    `PyOS_mystrnicmp()`, respectively.

# Character classification and conversion

`ctype.h`) character classification and conversion.
The argument must be a signed or unsigned char.

Py\_ISALNUM(c)
Return true if the character *c* is an alphanumeric character.

Py\_ISALPHA(c)
Return true if the character *c* is an alphabetic character (`a-z` and `A-Z`).

Py\_ISUPPER(c)
Return true if the character *c* is an uppercase ASCII letter (`A-Z`).

Py\_ISSPACE(c)
Return true if the character *c* is a whitespace character (space, tab,
    carriage return, newline, vertical tab, or form feed).

Py\_ISXDIGIT(c)
Return true if the character *c* is a hexadecimal digit (`0-9`, `a-f`, and
    `A-F`).

Py\_TOLOWER(c)
