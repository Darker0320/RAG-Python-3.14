# Boolean Objects

Booleans in Python are implemented as a subclass of integers. There are only
two booleans, `Py_False` and `Py_True`. As such, the normal
creation and deletion functions don’t apply to booleans. The following macros
are available, however.

PyTypeObjectPyBool\_Type
*Part of the Stable ABI.*

    This instance of `PyTypeObject` represents the Python boolean type; it
    is the same object as `bool` in the Python layer.

intPyBool\_Check(PyObject\*o)
Return true if *o* is of type `PyBool_Type`. This function always
    succeeds.

PyObject\*Py\_False
The Python `False` object. This object has no methods and is
    immortal.

    Changed in version 3.12: `Py_False` is immortal.

PyObject\*Py\_True
The Python `True` object. This object has no methods and is
    immortal.

    Changed in version 3.12: `Py_True` is immortal.

Py\_RETURN\_FALSE
Return `Py_False` from a function.

Py\_RETURN\_TRUE
Return `Py_True` from a function.

PyObject\*PyBool\_FromLong(longv)
*Return value: New reference.* *Part of the Stable ABI.*

    Return `Py_True` or `Py_False`, depending on the truth value of *v*.
